## Project Overview

InspireWrite is built to spark creativity by delivering daily writing prompts and a supportive community for sharing ideas. The frontend is the user interface that enables users to:
- View and interact with writing prompts
- Navigate through various sections of the website
- Engage with community-driven content
  
Built with performance and modern web development in mind, the project leverages the speed of Vite, the styling efficiency of Tailwind CSS, and the robust routing provided by React Router DOM.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before running the project locally:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prasadkadam03/INSPIREWRITE.git
   cd INSPIREWRITE/frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables (Optional):**

   ```dotenv
   VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
   ```

## Development

### Running Locally

To start the development server with hot module replacement, run:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```
This command starts Vite’s development server, usually available at `http://localhost:3000`, allowing you to see changes in real time.

### Available Scripts

- **`dev`**: Starts the development server.
- **`build`**: Builds the app for production, outputting files to the `dist` directory.
- **`preview`**: Locally preview the production build using Vite's preview command.

*Refer to your `package.json` file for any additional custom scripts.*

## Building for Production

To generate an optimized production build, run:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run build
```
Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```

The production build is saved in the `dist` directory. These files are ready to be deployed on your chosen hosting platform.

---

## Deployment

The production build from the `dist` directory can be deployed to a static hosting provider such as Vercel, Netlify, or any other hosting service that supports static websites. A typical deployment process would involve:
1. Committing and pushing your changes to the repository.
2. Connecting your GitHub repository to your deployment service.
3. Configuring the service to run the `npm run build` command.
4. Deploying the `dist` folder as a static website.

Check your hosting provider’s documentation for detailed deployment instructions.
